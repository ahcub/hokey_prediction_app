This app implements next formulas for probability calculation

1) hits_count_mult_success_percent
    player_scoring_probability = ASN * SP
    where
    ASN: Average amount of shoots on goal
    SP: Percent of successive shoots

2) match_based_probabilities
    player_scoring_probability = (GS / GP) * ZRS * 100
    GS: number of games player scored
    GP: number of games player played
    ZRS: current amount of streak of games player didn't scored
    100: percentage multiplier
